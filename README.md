### Why this forked version appear?
Since the original mod has been marked as abandoned. That's mean it cannot be searched by CurseForge. As a Modpack player and developer, it is not a good news. Therefore, this forked version has appeared.  
**Note that the version of 1.7.10 is maintained by GTNewHorizons. Special thanks to them!**

### What is the difference between the original version?
Since I am not very good at forge API. Therefore, it just provides some bug fix. However, I will try my best to maybe provide more function and update it to version 1.16. But of course, I need some time to learn the forge API ;) Feel free to create a pull request if you have some idea of the coding so that it can make the mod more fantastic.

### Is this Mod contains the license from original version?
Yes since the original version is based on the MIT license. Therefore, it is fine to create this forked version.

## DO NOT INSTALL BOTH original version and this forked version!
